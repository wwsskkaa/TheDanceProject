One of my best friends once said, “to me, ballet represents the nonstop practice for 13 hours
every week for 17 years in a row; it also represents the spirit of ‘never giving up’ even though
my feet hurt every second. So, during my performance, don’t just stare at my hair, my sparkling
dress or the fancy setting on the stage. Stare at my movements, they will tell you about my
passion and all my efforts.”


The Dance Project transforms videos of several dancers from different backgrounds into simpler
representations of their pure movements. This approach drops many barriers and divides
between types of dance, for the purpose of exposing common origins and expressions. Tint,
OpenCV, load/update pixels are used in this project. This piece begins with the original dance
videos, then the music will be stripped off, followed by the background and the lighting, then the
details of the clothes too, leaving the dancers only with their outlines. A series of 2d
representations over time simplifies and highlights technical aspects of dance such as the path
limbs may follow and the center of motion. Dissociating the dancer and the background forces
the viewers to ignore all the pinups involved in formal performance, appreciating dance as an
expression of emotions and as physical release.
